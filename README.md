With easy to define links next to the image, which hover when selected, a list of three simple worded links, 'Teams', 'Fixtures', 'TeamGroup', diverts the user to be able to see and achieve the list of functions, as highlighted in the Description Section.

Known Bugs/Errors and Troubleshooting
There has been a derogative testing of the application in order to make sure that there is a fully operational, fully purposed system that achieves everything that is set out. 
Through testing procedures, it was determined that all expected functionality worked, and allows the user to add teams or set fixtures for a set time etc. allowing for a range of interactive operations. 
There was however, one Known Bug that has been fully noted of with the application, which is, the ability for ANY user to add/edit/delete information on the application without authorization. Authentication allows for improved security, as well as providing a lower risk for unscrupulous behavior. 
While currently, the application does not pose a fully operational authorization policy or function, we are working thoroughly to implement the system, and make sure that there is reduced liability of damage/loss of information, as well. 
For more errors that arrive during the using experience, the contact information above should give enough method of communication to fix.
